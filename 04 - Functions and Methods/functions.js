/* 
FUNCTIONS:
--> Functions fall under the OBJECT Data type

functions allow us define a block of code, that we can call and execute any time we want

think of functions like a box with some code inside of it

we can call the functions and execute the code outside of the box 

--> handy feature, we can define a function once, and call it multiple times
